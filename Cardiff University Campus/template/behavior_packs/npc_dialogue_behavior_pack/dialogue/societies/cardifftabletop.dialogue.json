We welcome anyone who is interested in Boardgaming, Tabletop Role Playing Games (TTRPGs), Collectible Card Games (CCGs), Wargaming (Warhammer 40k, AoS etc.) and assorted other geekery, whether you're a seasoned veteran or someone interested in trying things out for the first time.\n\nWorried it's all a bit much for you or you need to be a super-geek to join? Don't be. A huge number of our long-time members had never done anything like this before they came to us. You can be anywhere on the geek scale from 0 to Wil Wheaton. We don't bite and we're happy to teach you how to play.",
