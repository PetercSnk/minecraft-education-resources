Often compared to an underground assault course, a caving trip can involve short climbs, raging streamways, as well as tight passages which open up into enormous underground chambers. A trip could last several hours, and can be challenging, but is always fun!\n\nWe organise trips to some of the biggest and most beautiful caves all over the UK - we regularly cave in the Brecon Beacons and Mendips, and also offer some longer trips to North Wales, the Peak District and the Yorkshire Dales. These include both day trips and overnight stays with lots of caving and social opportunities! We also take part in national events for students cavers (CHECC) at least twice a year which gives lots more oppotunities.",
