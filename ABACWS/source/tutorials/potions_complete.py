# the aim of this class is to use and understand linear search

# linear search traverses an array until an element is found

# let's say our array is [0, 1, 11, 6], and our chosen value is 6
# visit each element left-to-right until we find the value 6
# when a match is NOT found, move onto the next element
# when a match is found, stop the process and output index

# traverse the different blocks until your chosen block is found
# when a chosen block is found, interact with the button
# buttons will provide you with the ingredient shown above it
# follow the recipes to brew potions with the ingredients 

# to complete this class brew a splash potion of strength 2

# use a for loop with range(NUM_BLOCKS) to traverse the blocks
# use these commands to control your familiar:

# agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, DIRECTION)   # id of inspected block
# agent.interact(DIRECTION)             # interact with button
# agent.move(DIRECTION, NUM_BLOCKS)     # moves a direction, x amount of blocks
# start = world(-323, -53, 244)         # start position
# agent.teleport(start, EAST)           # teleports to start

# DIRECTIONS are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, FORWARD, and BACK

# block ids:
# oak planks 5, cobblestone 4, sandstone 24, quartz block 155, 
# lime concrete 236, shroomlight 766, bricks 45, hay bale 170, 
# purpur block 201, redstone block 152, glowstone 89

# speak to Tanith if you need to reset your pet 

# write your code here
