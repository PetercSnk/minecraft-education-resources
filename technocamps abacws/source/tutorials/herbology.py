# the aim of this class is to use and understand data types

# always consider what data types are most appropriate for your code 
# to do this you should look at how and why you are using them

# in Python data types will be assigned for us, nice!
# BUT, it is important to know what data type is assigned
# the data type assigned may not be the one you want

# the data types we will look at in this class are:
# integer, string, float, boolean, list, and tuple

# use integers for whole numbers
# height_cm = 25                

# strings are good for storing a series of characters
# name = "Flower"    

# floats are used when decimals are needed
# lifespan_years = 0.5          

# if something can be either true or false use a boolean
# dangerous = False            

# lists are good for storing and manipulating data
# owners = ["bob", "john"]    

# tuples cannot be changed after assigned (immutable)
# good for returning multiple things in a function!
# colours = ("pink", "white")   

# go out and explore the gardens, find plants and document their properties
# make sure to use a suitable name when assigning your data to variables

# to complete this class you will need collect the required samples 

# write your code here
